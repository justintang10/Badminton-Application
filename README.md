# Badminton Application

## Purpose
For my project, I am going to create a badminton application that keeps track of scores and statistics. 
It will let input the players name on the court, keep track of the score,
who is serving to who, the position of players in doubles, statistics at the end of the match. 
Possible features includes a chart visualizing the points differential throughout the match,
service ace tracker, service fault tracker, longest rally of the match, a table that displays win/loss percentage 
against people that played. 

Anybody that loves to make badminton can use to app to keep track of the score and who is serving to who; especially 
in doubles when the position of the players are always changing. This project is of interest to me becuase 
I love the sport of badminton and am that person that always forget who is serving.
