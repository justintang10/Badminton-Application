# Badminton Application 

## Purpose
For my project, I am going to create a badminton application that keeps track of scores and statistics. 
It will let input the players name on the court, keep track of the score,
who is serving to who, the position of players in doubles, statistics at the end of the match. 
Possible features includes a chart visualizing the points differential throughout the match,
service ace tracker, service fault tracker, longest rally of the match, a table that displays win/loss percentage 
against people that played. 

Anybody that loves to make badminton can use to app to keep track of the score and who is serving to who; especially 
in doubles when the position of the players are always changing. This project is of interest to me becuase 
I love the sport of badminton and am that person that always forget who is serving. 
## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to add players(X) to the current session that is being played(Y)
- As a user, I want to be able to see the amount of players in the session
- As a user, I want to be able to keep track of scoring for the match
- As a user, I want to be able to see a players wins and losses
- As a user I want to save the list of players that are in the current session 
  along with their wins and losses
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load the list of players 
  from previous session

## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required action related to add Xs to a Y by typing the name of the player into the text field and clicking the add button 
- You can generate the second required action related to removing a X in the Y by typing the name of the player into the text field and clicking the remove button
- You can locate my visual component at the top middle of the GUI
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button

## Phase 4: Task 3
Looking at my UML diagram, I was not able to implement everything that I wanted
into my app. If I had more time working on it, I would refactor it so that
my list of players is implemented directly into my Match class. This would
make the code less messy. I would also 
make the Match usable in the app and implement it into the GUI
